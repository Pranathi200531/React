Information Gathered:
- The file is a React functional component for a Movies Website.
- It imports React, Firebase auth and database, and other components.
- It manages state for language, movies, featured movie, user profile, and contact page visibility.
- It filters movies by language and displays user details and movies.
- It handles user login/logout, language change, and navigation to About and Contact pages.
- The moviesList is a large array of movie objects with id, title, language, and base64 image data.

Potential Issues to Check:
- Proper handling of user state and Firebase database subscription.
- Correct use of React hooks and state updates.
- Handling of edge cases when userProfile or movies are empty.
- Proper cleanup of Firebase onValue listener.
- Correct rendering of ContactPage and AboutPage components.
- Any missing or incorrect props usage.
- Performance considerations with large base64 images.
- Any syntax or runtime errors.

Plan:
1. Verify and fix Firebase onValue listener cleanup in useEffect.
2. Ensure userProfile state is correctly set and used.
3. Add error handling for missing or empty data.
4. Confirm all props are used correctly and passed down.
5. Optimize rendering of movies list and featured movie.
6. Verify ContactPage and AboutPage navigation and rendering.
7. Check for any missing imports or unused variables.
8. Test logout functionality and state reset.
9. Review CSS class usage for consistency.
10. Test language change logic and UI update.
11. Remove any console errors or warnings.
12. Consider lazy loading or optimization for large images if needed.

Dependent Files to Check:

Followup Steps:
